# Kidney Stone Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of kidney stone formation using machine learning models. The project leverages IBM Cloud services, including IBM Watson Studio and AutoAI, to build, train, and deploy the model. The deployed model is then integrated into a web application that takes user input, sends it to the deployed model endpoint, and displays the prediction.
